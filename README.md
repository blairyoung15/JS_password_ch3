## Description
For this project, the client needs strong passwords created to ensure greater secruity. To help the client, we created a random password generator that generates unique passwords based on certain criteria. 

The password should be a length between 8-128 characters long. After clicking the generate password button, the user will be prompted through a series of questions asking if they would like to include any of the following criteria as well: 
    -lowercase characters
    -uppercase characters
    -numbers (0-9)
    -special characters

Once the user cycles through the character criteria questions, a random password will be generated in the window to display their selected length of password. 


## Usage

The images show what it will look like for the user to move throughout the prompts. To start the function, the user will need to hit the button "Generate Password". A window alert first allows the user to select the password length. If an appropriate length is not selected, user will see a window alert stating "Please enter a length between 8-128 characters" and the page will be refreshed for the user to enter a correct length. If the user selects a lenght between 8 and 128, user is then sent on to window prompts asking about adding lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters in password. For loops were created for each corresponding variable in order to generate the characters into password. Upon completion of last prompt, user will see generated password in window. To create a new additional unique password, user can select generate password button again and the prompts will start over again.
